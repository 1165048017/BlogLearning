The old functions about "acclaimReadSkel.m" and "acclaimLoadChannels.m" may not run correctly in matlab 2012 and higher versions
 because of the wrong using of function "getline.m" and missing "tokenise.m".
_______________________________________________________________________
This version mainly correct this two functions for higher matlab versions and add the "tokenise.m".For example please run "example.m"
which is obtained from Neil D. Lawrence's github.
